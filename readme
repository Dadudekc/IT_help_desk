Future Improvements
These potential features and upgrades aim to enhance the IT Help Desk application, making it more adaptable, secure, and efficient for diverse user roles.

1. Role-Based Access and Permissions
Expanded User Roles: Introduce additional roles like Admin, Manager, and Technician to enhance permissions.
Permissions Matrix:
User: Submit and view personal tickets.
Technician: View, manage, and resolve tickets.
Manager: Assign tickets, view reports, and oversee technicians.
Admin: Manage users, configure settings, and generate reports.
Implementation:
Define roles and permissions in the database.
Use role-based tab visibility in MainWindow and add role-specific menu options, e.g., Manage Users for Admins.
2. Enhanced Ticket Management
Status Tracking: Add status options like In Progress, Awaiting Customer Response, and Closed.
Priority Levels: Enable users to assign priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent) to tickets, with display ordering by priority and status.
Assignment and Notifications:
Enable Managers to assign tickets to specific technicians.
Send email notifications when tickets are created, updated, or closed.
Comments Section: Add a discussion thread to each ticket for interaction between users and technicians, sorted chronologically.
3. AI-Powered Features (Mistral 7B Integration)
Automated Ticket Response: Use Mistral 7B for initial troubleshooting by providing potential solutions or guidance when a ticket is submitted.
Predictive Analysis: Categorize issues based on keywords and recommend assignments to technicians based on historical data.
AI Chatbot Integration: Implement a chatbot to handle simple support queries, answer FAQs, or collect details before a human takes over.
4. Reporting and Analytics
Role-Specific Dashboards:
Managers and Admins: View key metrics like resolved tickets, average resolution time, open ticket counts, and ticket trends.
Detailed Reports: Generate CSV/PDF reports on resolution time, user satisfaction, and technician performance.
Real-Time Tracking: Display ticket counts across categories and status (e.g., open, closed, high-priority tickets).
5. Advanced User Management and Authentication
User Profiles and Roles Management: Enable Admins to add, edit, and deactivate users.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Add an option for 2FA to enhance security.
User Settings and Preferences: Allow users to customize notification preferences, view activity history, and manage profile details.
6. Knowledge Base Integration

Help Desk API: Create an API for external systems to interact with the ticket system.
Collaboration Tool Integrations: Integrate with Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord for real-time ticket updates and alerts.
Sample Role-Based Implementation
Below is an example of how the MainWindow class could be expanded to support role-based access:


class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self, user_id, user_role):
        super().__init__()
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.user_role = user_role
        self.setWindowTitle("IT Help Desk")
        self.setGeometry(100, 100, 1000, 700)

        self.tabs = QTabWidget()
        self.setCentralWidget(self.tabs)

        # Add common tabs for all users
        self.tabs.addTab(SubmitTicketTab(self.user_id), "Submit Ticket")
        self.tabs.addTab(ViewTicketsTab(self.user_id, self.user_role), "View Tickets")

        # Add additional tabs based on role
        if self.user_role in ['technician', 'manager', 'admin']:
            self.tabs.addTab(ManageTicketsTab(self.user_role), "Manage Tickets")

        if self.user_role == 'admin':
            self.tabs.addTab(UserManagementTab(), "User Management")

Additional Tabs and Classes
UserManagementTab: For Admins to manage users and assign roles.
ManageTicketsTab: Allows technicians and managers to filter, assign, and resolve tickets with status and priority settings.
